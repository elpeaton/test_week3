Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of

the printing and typesetting industry.

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy
text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer 

took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a
type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries,
but also the leap into electronic typesetting,

remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the

1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker 

including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

Pull request review comments are comments on a 
portion of the unified diff made during a pull 
request review. Commit comments and issue comments
are different from pull request review comments. 
You apply commit comments directly to a commit and you
apply issue comments without referencing a portion
of the unified diff. For more information,
see "Create a commit comment" and "Create an issue comment."
